The RAW segment contains only data.
The TYPE segment contains type information.
TYPE segment is a list of type descriptions.
A type description starts with a TYPEDESCRIPTOR. A possible TYPEDESCRIPTOR is a TYPEID. A possible TYPEID is a simple TYPEID, a simple TYPEID is a 6 bit signed value encoded as byte.
Simple TYPEID   |     Meaning
=================================
0               | EOS(End Of Stream)
1               | signed 8 bit value
2               | unsigned 8 bit value
3               | signed 16 bit value
4               | unsigned 16 bit value
5               | signed 32 bit value
6               | unsigned 32 bit integer
7               | signed 64 bit integer
8               | unsigned 64 bit integer
9               | signed 128 bit integer
10              | unsigned 128 bit integer
11              | half precision floating point
12              | single precision floating point
13              | double precision floating point
14              | double extended precision floating point
15              | ASCIIZ
16              | UTF8

A TYPEID can be followed by a number denoting the number of entities, this is called a RLE (Run Length Encoded) TYPEID. A TYPEID is a RLE TYPEID if it is negative. The meaning of a RLE TYPEID T
is the meaning of the TYPEID abs(T).

Examples
========

RAW:
0x01 0x02 0x03
TYPE:
0x01 0x01 0x01 0x00

Meaning: three signed bytes 1,2,3

Equivalent encoding with RLE TYPEID:

RAW:
0x01 0x02 0x03
TYPE:
0x3F 0x03 0x00
